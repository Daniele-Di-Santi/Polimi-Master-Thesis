Title: Concept Based Explanations for Image Classifiers using Textual Prompts
The thesis offers a scalable solution to enhance the CNNs'transparency in the field of eXplaibale Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
We use the multimodal model CLIP to compute, from textual input, the latent representation of an arbitrary set of Concepts that can be used to inspect the inner process of an arbitrary CNN.
This solution grant us more control over the knowledge learned by the CNN and we can use it also beyond the XAI.
The Concept can be used also for tasks of Localization, in fact we can filter the features extracted by the CNN to have only the relevant information and draw in this way an heat map (or a bounding box) over the part of the image that displays that Concept.
